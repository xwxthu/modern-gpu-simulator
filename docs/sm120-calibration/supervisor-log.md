# SM120 Calibration Supervisor Log

## Restated User Requirements

Purpose: evolve `modern-gpu-simulator` into a simulator organized as "SM120 architecture modeling is common across the architecture, while GPU-specific hardware parameters have a runnable calibration flow".

Repository scope:
- Develop in `/home/xiewx/accel-0608/modern-gpu-simulator`.
- Use `/home/xiewx/accel-0608/accel-sim-framework` only as a reference.
- `ref-docs/` contains the Accel-Sim paper and the MICRO25 NVIDIA reverse-engineering paper and should be used as reference material.

Background:
- The MICRO25 paper substantially remodeled Accel-Sim and claims Blackwell support.
- The artifact appears to have been tested only on RTX 5070 Ti.
- It does not yet provide an Accel-Sim-style calibration flow for SM120-series GPUs.
- The local `dev-5060` branch has adapted the artifact enough to run on RTX 5060, but the desired end state is not a 5060-specific simulator. It should be an SM120-common model plus per-GPU calibrated parameter sets.

Hardware and execution constraints:
- This server is suitable for building and running the simulator, but it does not have an RTX 5060.
- The RTX 5060 is available through `ssh dsp5060`.
- The GPU server should be used only for GPU-dependent collection work. Do not run full simulator workloads there, and do not place the main workspace there.
- Create and manage a local Python `.venv` as needed.
- Target the modern toolchain, including CUDA 13.2 rather than the old Accel-Sim-era CUDA/nvprof flow.

Obstacle policy:
- For hardware parameters readable through NVIDIA official tools, read them directly.
- For parameters that cannot be read directly, design microbenchmarks that isolate one parameter as much as practical.
- Avoid brute-force search over a large parameter space. Use staged microbenchmark measurement first, then small targeted correlation searches.
- If a very difficult obstacle appears, pause for discussion rather than using a complex workaround that heavily damages code structure.
- The framework should remain useful even if future Blackwell/SM120 architecture modeling changes.

Required workflow:
- The supervisor sets stage goals, manages logs/plans, delegates implementation to subagent workers, and records key actions.
- Workers may create their own scoped plans/logs but must follow the documentation scheme.
- Each worker must review its own work by spawning a secondary reviewer. The worker should address worthwhile reviewer feedback and repeat with a fresh reviewer until the reviewer accepts the result.
- After a worker reports completion, the supervisor spawns an independent reviewer. If needed, the supervisor returns the task for rework.
- At stable checkpoints, the supervisor updates the overall plan and creates git commits with reasonably detailed commit messages.
- Prefer blank-context subagents. Each subagent must understand its own role and mission.
- The supervisor should avoid doing the worker's implementation work directly.
- If context compaction occurs, first reread this log section and `overall-plan.md`, then continue.

## Documentation Scheme

Directory: `docs/sm120-calibration/`

Required files:
- `supervisor-log.md`: top-level chronological log owned by the supervisor.
- `overall-plan.md`: stage plan, acceptance criteria, current status, and checkpoint history.
- `worker-logs/`: worker/reviewer-created logs. A worker log must include purpose, base commit, branch/worktree state, timestamp, assigned scope, actions, evidence, changed files, reviewer rounds, and final status.
- `handoffs/`: optional worker handoff summaries when useful.

Naming:
- Worker logs: `worker-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-topic>.md`.
- Reviewer notes inside worker logs are preferred. If a separate reviewer note is needed: `reviewer-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-topic>.md`.

Log rules:
- Use precise repository paths.
- Record commit hash and timestamp for every stage start and completion.
- Mark whether changes are documentation-only, code, scripts, experiments, or generated outputs.
- Record commands and results only when they are important evidence.

## Chronological Log

### 2026-06-08 17:41:35 CST

Base repository state:
- Repo: `/home/xiewx/accel-0608/modern-gpu-simulator`
- Branch: `dev-5060`
- Base commit: `b52920c838b752fcfd6ca9e1557ae924cdc36cb1`
- Working tree: clean at initial supervisor setup

Action:
- Started a fresh documentation scheme for the SM120 calibration effort.
- Created the top-level restatement and governance log for the requested supervisor/worker/reviewer workflow.

### 2026-06-08 17:43:47 CST

Action:
- Spawned S1 audit worker `019ea69c-fe3c-7a02-a71e-93ff5d7a96f8`.
- Spawned S0 documentation reviewer `019ea69d-4575-7911-a5e6-1dcdb1d15945`.

Reviewer result:
- Recommendation: accept.
- Finding: S0 status in `overall-plan.md` was still `Not started` despite S0 being established.

Follow-up:
- Updated S0 status to `Complete`.
- Marked S1 as the current active stage.
